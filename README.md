# History-is-happening
I always think about history recently, a Chinese ancient saying from the Emperpor Taizong of Tang Dynasty. 
> "以铜为鉴，可以正衣冠，以人为鉴，可以明得失，以史为鉴，可以知兴替 (By using bronze as a mirror, one can correct one's attire; by using others as a mirror, one can understand one's strengths and weaknesses; by using history as a mirror, one can learn the rise and fall of powers.)"

From ancient times to the present, People have often been eager to predict the future, though few succeed. However, seeing the future is far less clear than seeing the past. We can learn much from history. With a history spanning 5000 years, humanity has seen countless suitations that mirror our own. If you want to do something today, it's almost certain that someone in ancient times had a similar experience. 

Some may argue that history is a serious matter that should be documented by professionals. To some extend, I agree with this. However, I also believe that everyone is a witness to history, and each person has the right to record their own experiences.

Offical history is written from the perpective of the ruling class. While I cannot say it's entirely wrong, it is certainly crafted to benefit the authorities and often overlooks many details, particularly the perspectives of ordinary people.

For example, at the end of the COVID-19 era, the Chinese goverment declared a great victory, and all the Chinese media reported extensively on how much had been accomplished. Simultaneously, CCTV news continued to report daily on the number of illnesses and deaths in the U.S. I can not help but wonder: Is this really true? Are the Chinese people truly living in a safer environment than those in the U.S.? Offical history won't tell us how ordinary people felt during that dreadful time and how much they endured. It will only record how successfully the national leaders guided the Chinese people through the COVID-19 crisis. It is dangerous! Real history shouldn't be forgoten.

I can no longer tolerate the covering up or ignoring of facts, nor the misinterpretation of history. I oppose all forms of historical revisionism, whether it involves glorification or vilification. Therefore, my commitment to the truth drives me to record my own perspective as an ordinary citizen. I hope that one day, these records can serve as a reference for future generations, allowing them to gain a deeper understand of the world, the country, the people, and the history.

And I believe I'm not the first one to do this, and I'm definitly not the last one.

Overall, the two main reasons I determine to record are 1. To be a truth recorder, offer a different perspective for this world 2. To practice my English writing skills.

I'm not a native English speaker, so the history I record might not be as native as yours. If you find something wrong or you have some different opinions, please submit issues or contact me directly. I would be happy to see that and communicate with you！

#### Declaration
1. Everything I have documented actually happened, I will not make up any story.
2. I am not a country hater, I just want to express my own perspective and share my own experience. I hope my motherland will become a powerful, free and really democratic country as most compatriots want. And I will work for it.
